# Beach Town Tourism Website

## Design project for Epicodus - 2019-0226

#### By Tracy Reith and David Monarrez

### Description
Web advertising campaign to promote tourism in a beach town. A web development project for Epicodus.

### Learning Objective
Practice setting up a web development environment and design and build a responsive website, while applying web design best practices.

## Target Audiences / Demographics
* Young people
* Retirees

## Non-technical Requirements  
* More appealing to younger generations--but without making some of their most loyal, often retired, visitors feel left behind.

* Feel like a "fresh take on the old beach towns you know and love. New and fresh, but still familiar and comfortable.

* Make the quaintness of a small community feel "cool" and "hip" again.

* Tap the weekend-trips market; encourage people to spontaneously drop by on a whim

* Pages that are both desktop and mobile friendly. They know those younger generations especially use many different devices to browse the web.

* Homepage of the mobile version should feature tips on accessing their town more prominently than the desktop version; they think people may try to look up directions on their phones as they're traveling to the town.

## Content
* An area to feature all the fun events the town hosts. (They mention an art weekend, farmer's markets in the summer, a small folk music festival, and a crab cookout, and more.)

* Directions to the town.

* An area to feature local attractions and things visitors could entertain themselves doing.

* Prominent pictures of the beach, and beautiful surrounding landscape.

* An area that lists to local hotels and restaurants.

* An area they can feature relevant media and news from and about the town.
